## Assignment 1 - Spatial Filtering
For the given noisy image, 
1. Apply low pass filter of 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 mask sized.
2. Apply Gaussian filter of 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 mask sized.
3. Apply bilateral filter.
4. Apply Non-local means filter.

Finally, apply no-reference image quality assessment algorithm to judge which method is working the best.

Prepare a 2-page report with the observations and which method you feel is the best.
